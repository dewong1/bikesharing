Work with data visualization software called *Tableau* to present business proposal for a bike-sharing company 


## Overview of Project
*Tableau* is an excellent tool for data visualization. There are two primary ways that Tableau connects to the data you provide: through *live data* (e.g. MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server) or *extract data* (CSV, TXT, or PDF). First, we imported, styled, and portrayed (NYC bike) data accurately. Then, we created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataest. In our original Tableau workbook, we created the following worksheets: *Number of Rides, Customers, August Peak Hours, Top Starting Locations, Top Ending Locations, Gender Breakdown, Average Trip Duration, Bike Repairs, Bike Utilization, NYC Citi Bike (Dashboard), and NYC Story*. We have to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. The purpose of the project was to do a bike trip analysis. We created another Tableau workbook with the additional worksheets: *Checkout Times for Users, Checkout Times by Gender, Trips by Weekday for Each Hour, Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour), User Trips by Gender by Weekday, and NYC Citi Bike Analysis (story)*. These combined visualizations is our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Summary

Based on the bikesharing data analysis, it can be inferred that most of the users are probably locals commuting for work rather than tourists. Most bikes were checked-out on workday (M-F) mornings and workday (M-F) evenings, especially Thursday evening (5-6 pm). According to the gender data, it appears that most of the clients (subscribers) are male users. This information can be taken into consideration in terms of marketing purposes based off the demographics of Des Moines. And based off the *Checkout Times for Users* graph, it displays that the most ride durations peaked at around 5 minutes (shorter distance). Taking this into account, if there were to be a bike-sharing program set up in Des Moines, perhaps bike stations can be set up within 10 minutes of biking distance from each other. Two additional visualizations that I would perform with the given dataset would be: 1) number of bike trips for all riders and birth year, and 2) number of bike trips for all riders and birth year for each hour of each day of the week.
